# Event-planner-web
The Personal Event Planner website is designed to help users plan and search for events based on their preferences. The website has two main features: an event form and a search form.

The event form allows users to input details about their upcoming event, such as the event name, date, time, location, and any notes they may have. Once the user submits the form, the event will be added to the planner.

The search form allows users to search for events based on specific criteria, such as the event name, date, and location. Users can input their search criteria and click the search button to see a list of events that match their preferences.

The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and utilizes the Tailwind CSS framework for styling. It also uses Leaflet and Mapbox for displaying the location of the events.
